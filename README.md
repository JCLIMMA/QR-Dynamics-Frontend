# QR Dynamics Frontend

The backend required to get this thing fully functional can be found here: https://github.com/oliver-dvorski/qr-dynamics-backend

Copy your `.env.local.example` file to `.env.local`, reconfigure it if necessary. That should be all the setup you need to get the frontend up and running.
